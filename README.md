# README

Hey everyone!
I am currently practicing web development with ruby on rails. You can consider this a test run for building another app on my own. As you can see in my Github account, I already created another app called "edible hood". 
To run this App you need to have Ruby and Rails installed and run the following url in your browser: localhost:3000


Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: 2.3.1 

* Rails version: 5.0.0.1

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* Have fun with the app! And commit the changes
