Notes:

<p>
  <%= link_to 'Delete Comment', [comment.product, comment],
               :confirm => 'Are you sure?',
               :method => :delete,
               class: "btn btn-default" %>
               
</p>

this is the link to delete comments under the products. i took it out because any user was able to delete anyone else's comment. until i find a solution, i will save it here.


<% #if admin_user_signed_in? %>
  <%= #link_to ('<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span>').html_safe, product_comment_path(comment.product, comment), method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' } %>
<% # end %>
