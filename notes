Notes:

<p>
  <%= link_to 'Delete Comment', [comment.product, comment],
               :confirm => 'Are you sure?',
               :method => :delete,
               class: "btn btn-default" %>
               
</p>

this is the link to delete comments under the products. i took it out because any user was able to delete anyone else's comment. until i find a solution, i will save it here.
